## Description
        
In this project, I used inquirer and mysql to create an employee management system. The program works by invoking it with "node server.js", which will run the code in the server.js file. This code establishes a connection to a database, and upon establishing the connection to the database runs a function that prompts the user as to what they would like to do within the employee management system. I use a switch to change between the choice that the user picks, and each of the switch cases calls a function that will handle what the user seeks. 

## Installation 

Clone into repository and run node server.js
